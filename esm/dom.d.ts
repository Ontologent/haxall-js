/**
 * Event models the DOM event object.
 * 
 * Common event types:
 * ```
 * "mousedown"   Fired when a mouse button is pressed on an element.
 * 
 * "mouseup"     Fired when a mouse button is released over an element.
 * 
 * "click"       Fired when a mouse button is pressed and released on a
 *               single element.
 * 
 * "dblclick"    Fired when a mouse button is clicked twice on a single element.
 * 
 * "mousemove"   Fired when a mouse is moved while over an element.
 * 
 * "mouseover"   Fired when mouse is moved onto the element that has the
 *               listener attached or onto one of its children.
 * 
 * "mouseout"    Fired when mouse is moved off the element that has the
 *               listener attached or off one of its children.
 * 
 * "mouseenter"  Fired when mouse is moved over the element that has the
 *               listener attached. Similar to '"mouseover"', it differs in
 *               that it doesn't bubble and that it isn't sent when the mouse
 *               is moved from one of its descendants' physical space to its
 *               own physical space.
 * 
 *               With deep hierarchies, the amount of mouseenter events sent
 *               can be quite huge and cause significant performance problems.
 *               In such cases, it is better to listen for "mouseover" events.
 * 
 * "mouseleave"  Fired when mouse is moved off the element that has the
 *               listener attached. Similar to "mouseout", it differs in that
 *               it doesn't bubble and that it isn't sent until the pointer
 *               has moved from its physical space and the one of all its
 *               descendants.
 * 
 *               With deep hierarchies, the amount of mouseleave events sent
 *               can be quite huge and cause significant performance problems.
 *               In such cases, it is better to listen for "mouseout" events.
 * 
 * "contextmenu" Fired when the right button of the mouse is clicked (before
 *               the context menu is displayed), or when the context menu key
 *               is pressed (in which case the context menu is displayed at the
 *               bottom left of the focused element, unless the element is a
 *               tree, in which case the context menu is displayed at the
 *               bottom left of the current row).
 * 
 * 
 * "focus"       The focus event is fired when an element has received focus
 * 
 * "blur"        The blur event is fired when an element has lost focus.
 * 
 * "keydown"     Fired when a key is pressed down.
 * 
 * "keyup"       Fired when a key is released.
 * 
 * "keypress"    Fired when a key is pressed down and that key normally
 *               produces a character value (use "input" instead).
 * 
 * "input"       Fired synchronously when the value of an <input> or
 *               <textarea> element is changed.
 * 
 * "dragstart"   Fired on an element when a drag is started. The user is
 *               requesting to drag the element where the dragstart event is
 *               fired. During this event, a listener would set information
 *               such as the drag data and image to be associated with the drag.
 *               This event is not fired when dragging a file into the browser
 *               from the OS.
 * 
 * "dragenter"   Fired when the mouse enters an element while a drag is
 *               occurring. A listener for this event should indicate whether
 *               a drop is allowed over this location. If there are no listeners,
 *               or the listeners perform no operations, then a drop is not
 *               allowed by default. This is also the event to listen for in
 *               order to provide feedback that a drop is allowed, such as
 *               displaying a highlight or insertion marker.
 * 
 * "dragover"    This event is fired as the mouse is moving over an element
 *               when a drag is occurring. Much of the time, the operation that
 *               occurs during a listener will be the same as the "dragenter"
 *               event.
 * 
 * "dragleave"   This event is fired when the mouse leaves an element while a
 *               drag is occurring. Listeners should remove any highlighting
 *               or insertion markers used for drop feedback.
 * 
 * "drag"        This event is fired at the source of the drag and is the element
 *               where "dragstart" was fired during the drag operation.
 * 
 * "drop"        The drop event is fired on the element where the drop
 *               occurred at the end of the drag operation. A listener would
 *               be responsible for retrieving the data being dragged and
 *               inserting it at the drop location. This event will only fire
 *               if a drop is desired. It will not fire if the user cancelled
 *               the drag operation, for example by pressing the Escape key,
 *               or if the mouse button was released while the mouse was not
 *               over a valid drop target.
 * 
 * "dragend"     The source of the drag will receive a "dragend" event when the
 *               drag operation is complete, whether it was successful or not.
 *               This event is not fired when dragging a file into the browser
 *               from the OS.
